Many, many users have been letting me know about issues with saving and deleting over the past few weeks, and while I've been quiet, I haven't been idle. I've spent the last few weeks pulling apart the problematic code and rewriting parts to try and ensure that the bugs were fixed: hard work when you're unable to reproduce the problem!

With that in mind, this update brings a series of fixes that should ensure that GIFs are correctly saved and deleted as appropriate. My understanding of the situation is that for many users, changes made to the Library weren't being properly saved, which meant that they would revert after a relaunch, and changes made in an extension would never make it back to the main app (and vice versa).

If you're still having troubles after this update, please don't hesitate to throw an email towards support@gifwrapped.co, or hit up @gifwrapped on Twitter. I do my best to stay on top of everything, and I'll be glad to do what I can to help you out.
