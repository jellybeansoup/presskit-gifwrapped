Hey everyone, this update is small but mighty.

Despite attempts at resolving the longtime paging issue where selecting one GIF displays another, the problem still managed to persist. So in an effort to track it down once and for all, I dug deeperâ€¦ all the way into the custom paging view I'd built to discover some layout timing issues.

And so, this update rights this particular wrong, and hopefully puts an end to this saga. But if not, please hit me up with an email to support@gifwrapped.co, where you'll find me desperately trying to take a nap.

Until next time, remember: you look nice today.
