Yeah, hey, I'm back. I think I left some stuff here… do you mind checking around? Thanks. Also, while I'm here, I might as well let you know that I've fixed a little issue with the last release.

- Twitter's calls to it's own API are breaking (occasionally? it's hard to tell TBH), and it surfaced an issue within GIFwrapped's parsing. The good news is that I was able to pin it down and make the new infrastructure even better as a result.

That's it! Thanks for using GIFwrapped, and remember, if you need to reach out… you can toss an email at support@gifwrapped.co which will put it directly in front of my eyes.

Until next time, remember: you have the power to make someone's day!
