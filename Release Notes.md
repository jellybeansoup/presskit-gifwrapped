I’m back yet again, and attempting to resolve a number of problems that have been bothering people… and also some that weren’t.

- I doubled the number of alternative app icons available to Premium subscribers, mostly by adding a bunch of colour variations. There’s also a new screen that shows up in the Settings screen (again… for Premium subscribers), making the option a little easier to find.

- I (finally) added a full Search History list to Settings for Premium subscribers, with all the sweet functionality you'd expect. That should make it a little easier to manage.

- Keyboard shortcuts for the preview screen stopped working at some point, so I jumped in and wired them up again, adding some new ones to support the new paging feature while I was at it. What can I say? I'm a giver.

- Normally my philosophy is "I don't support iOS betas", but I was seeing a truckload of pointer-related crashes from people continuing to use early iOS 13.4 betas, even after it was officially released… and couldn't escape the emails/tweets. So I fixed it. Please update your dang phones.

- A previously-resolved bug seemed to have let some "malformed" names through when renaming entries, and despite resolving the issue itself, there were a handful of sync issues that resulted from these bad paths. I added some workarounds to help resolve these, so hopefully it should all balance out now.

- I've had one user in particular who has been struggling with a crash on launch that has been real hard to nail down. I went through my crash list, identifying and resolving a bunch of crashes… but knowing my luck, they’ll still have problems. I'm doing my best, promise!

If you spot any problems with the app, please be sure to let me know. Tweet @gifwrapped, or email support@gifwrapped.co, and I’ll be sure to take note.

Don’t forget to wash your hands!
