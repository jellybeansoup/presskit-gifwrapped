There's a lot going on with GIFwrapped, and this release is no exception. I've started making big strides towards a new, hugely-improved UI, but while there's still a bit to go on that, I wanted to introduce a couple of new things for y'all to enjoy in the meantime!

= GIFWRAPPED PREMIUM =

The largest and most important change is the introduction of GIFwrapped Premium: an auto-renewing subscription that will remove the ads and unlock extra features. By subscribing, you're also supporting GIFwrapped's ongoing development.

- GIFwrapped Premium replaces the mess of upgrades that were previously available, but if you already purchased one of those, you will continue to get the features you unlocked, exactly the same as before.

- This subscription gets charged to your iTunes account, and costs USD $3.49 per year (at the exact moment this sentence was written). It's renewed automatically—because that is the nature of an auto-renewing subscription—but don't fret: you can turn off auto-renewal at any time, and I'll still like you for who you are on the inside, even if I'm not getting paid.

- More information about GIFwrapped Premium is available in the User Guide, which can be found in the Settings tab, or online from gifwrapped.co/faq/gifwrapped-premium

= BURSTS AND LIVE PHOTOS =

This update also introduces something that's been in pre-release for a while, but which is now available to everyone: support for Bursts and Live Photos from your photo library! Quickly grab a GIF version of photos you take, and send 'em to friends. Great for realising you accidentally left live photo mode on when taking a picture of that cabinet in IKEA.

- Different image sources are grouped together to make things a little easier to manage, separating regular old GIFs from your own photos.

- Premium subscribers can disable the embedded watermark for GIFs created from Bursts and Live Photos, which is extra nice if you like GIFwrapped, but don't, you know… like-like GIFwrapped. It's totally OK if we don't have that sort of relationship, I'm cool with it.

= THE LITTLE STUFF =

As always, I've been hard at work improving some of the minor stuff too. You know what they say: there's no such thing as a small feature, just small… uh… code? I really don't know where I was going with that.

- You won't really notice, but a bunch of UI stuff got a big refresh with this release. This includes things like the share sheet, the grid views, drag and drop, and more. It's honestly a huge thing, I just don't have a lot of room to detail it all!

- The awful dialog you would get when the Save to GIFwrapped extension found multiple GIFs for a tweet or URL has been replaced with a new UI for choosing the GIFs to save, just like in the Search tab. So much easier!

- Nothing says pro like keyboard shortcuts, which I can almost guarantee no one will ever actually use, but hey… they're there, and they're super great. Whack that keyboard on your iPad and go to town, you deserve it.

- I get a whole lot of emails about people wanting to delete stuff, so my response is to add a thousand (or maybe just a couple) new ways to delete items, in places people are more likely to find 'em. If this works the way I planned, I'll spend less time answering emails, and more time reminiscing about the days when I got emails.

- The outlined consume bug I tried fixing the last time around managed to avoid my manic flailing, but since then I actually managed to stumble across it in real life, so now I can say with absolute certainty that it's actually fixed. Probably.

If you're wondering about a bug that I haven't mentioned here, or if you're struggling to figure something out with GIFwrapped, please reach out! Send an email to support@gifwrapped.co or hit up @gifwrapped on Twitter, and I'll be available to help where I can!

Thanks for reading the release notes! You're a heckin' champion, and I believe in you. Fly strong, you beautiful eagle of light. Let nothing keep you from your dreams!
