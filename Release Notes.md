If anyone ever wondered whether people actually use Messages apps, the answer is a resounding HECK YES, as demonstrated by the sheer number of emails, tweets, and carrier pigeons dispatched to let me know that it wasn't working.

- The order of operations somehow got mixed up when loading the Messages app, which… well… broke the Messages app, and stopped it from loading entirely. Not an ideal situation, but totally resolved now, so you can get back to sending those GIFs you had all pent up.

- The import menu found in the upper left corner of the Library was crashing on iOS 10. Turns out disabling the iCloud entitlements entirely was a bad move, so I've gone for a middle-ground solution, and voilà! It works again!
