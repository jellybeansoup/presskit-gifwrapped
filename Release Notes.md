Hello everyone. I'd hoped to get this release out sooner, but somehow, life always has other plans.

Good news, though… this one has some good stuff in it.

- It's been a long, long, long, long, long time coming… but GIFwrapped now has its first set of Shortcuts integrations. I'm not sure I'm 100% happy with them just yet, but we'll see where they go from here.

- It only took me until 2025, and MARCH at that, but the copyright dates no longer read 2023. What even was 2024, and why have static strings for things like this in the first place?

- For whatever reason, Catalyst apps on macOS don't automatically remember the last active window's location or other aspects of the screen's state… which means that GIFwrapped would just re-open in the centre of the active screen each time you open it, annoying the heck out of anyone who has opinions about window placement. You know who you are. I joke, but I also put in a bunch of effort to remember the windows most recent location and sidebar width, and I'll probably add some more aspects to the mix in future updates, because I made it easy to do.

- A release or two ago, I updated the mechanics of how I track file changes, and it seems like one of those changes caused changes that occur in the background to get… lost. Like with all lost things, I retraced my steps and somehow found it in the freezer. I've added a nice little workaround to ensure it checks for any changes on returning to the foreground, so we can all sleep a little better.

As always, if you need to reach out and tell me about all the things that are going horribly wrong, please toss an email at support@gifwrapped.co. I do a terrible job at responding to emails, but I read them all, and try to address any issues that come up.

Until next time, remember: you're not alone.
