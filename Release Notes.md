A few people noticed that the sharing menu wasn't actually doing much of anything, which is all kinds of not good. It'd show up, let you tap an option, and then pretty much disappear without so much of a "nice to see you". We had a little chat, I made some changes to the order of operations once you tap an option, and it should be much better behaved from now on.
